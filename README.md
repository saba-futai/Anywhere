# Anywhere

**The best VLESS client for iOS.**

A native, zero-dependency VLESS client built entirely in Swift.
No Electron. No WebView. No sing-box wrapper. Pure protocol implementation from the ground up.

## Why Anywhere?

Most iOS proxy clients wrap sing-box or Xray-core in a Go/C++ bridge. Anywhere takes a different approach — every protocol, every transport, and the entire packet tunnel stack is implemented natively in Swift and C. The result is a smaller binary, lower memory usage, tighter system integration, and no bridging overhead.

## Features

### Protocols & Security

- **VLESS** with full Vision (XTLS-RPRX-Vision) flow control and adaptive padding
- **Reality** with X25519 key exchange, TLS 1.3 fingerprint spoofing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, iOS)
- **TLS** with SNI, ALPN, and optional insecure mode
- **Transports:** TCP, WebSocket (with early data), HTTP Upgrade, XHTTP (stream-one & packet-up)
- **Mux** multiplexing with **XUDP** (GlobalID-based, BLAKE3 keyed hashing)

### App

- **One-tap connect** with animated status UI and real-time traffic stats
- **QR code scanner** for instant config import
- **Subscription import** with auto-detection and profile metadata
- **Manual editor** for full control over every parameter
- **Latency testing** with color-coded indicators and batch "Test All"
- **Domain routing rules** with exact, suffix, and keyword matching
- **Country bypass** — GeoIP-based split routing (AE, BY, CN, CU, IR, RU, SA, TM, TR, VN)
- **DNS over HTTPS** toggle
- **IPv6** support
- **Always On VPN**
- **Xray-core compatible** — works with standard V2Ray/Xray server deployments

### Architecture

- **Zero third-party dependencies** — Apple frameworks + vendored C libraries (lwIP, BLAKE3)
- **Native Packet Tunnel** — system-wide VPN via `NEPacketTunnelProvider` with userspace TCP/IP stack
- **Fake-IP DNS** — transparent domain-based routing for all apps
